<h1>✅ Forms Validation</h1>

This repository contains reusable components for creating and validating HTML elements such as Checkboxes, Dropdowns, Text Inputs, and Radio Buttons. Each component includes built-in validation for ease of use. The Validations are performed on onBlur, onChange and onSubmit.


The **onBlur** event in React is triggered when an element (like an input field) loses focus. It’s often used for field validation when the user finishes interacting with an input field.

The **onSubmit** event is triggered when the form is submitted. It’s a good place to check the validity of all fields before submitting the form data.

The **onSubmit** event is triggered when the form is submitted. It’s a good place to check the validity of all fields before submitting the form data.

✴️ State management with React useState to handle form data and validation errors.

✴️ Custom components (TextInput, RadioComponent, CheckBoxComp, DropDownComp) to handle various input types.

✴️ Validation logic that triggers on form submission and field blur to ensure that the form is filled out correctly.


This approach enables dynamic validation of each input field while the user interacts with the form, providing immediate feedback on errors.
